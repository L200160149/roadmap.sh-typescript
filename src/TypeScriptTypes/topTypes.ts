// (*) Top Types
// 1. Unknown
// unknown is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific type.
    function f1(a: any) {
        a.b(); // OK
    }
    function f2(a: unknown) {
        // 'a' is of type 'unknown'
        a.b();
    }

// 2. Any
    let objc: any = {x: 0}
    objc.foo();
    objc();
    objc.bar = 100;
    objc = 'hello';
    const n: number = objc;
